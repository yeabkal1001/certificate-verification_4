# Certificate Verification System - Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Certificate Verification System project, including completed tasks, current status, and future work. It's designed to help new developers or AI assistants understand the project quickly.

## Project Description

The Certificate Verification System is a web application that allows organizations to issue, verify, and manage digital certificates. It provides a secure and tamper-proof way to verify the authenticity of certificates using blockchain technology.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js application for user interface
2. **Backend API**: Node.js/Next.js API routes for business logic
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage
4. **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization
5. **Web Server**: Nginx for serving static content and reverse proxy
6. **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for observability
7. **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for deployment

- `NODE_ENV`: Application environment (development, production)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Secret for NextAuth.js
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret for JWT tokens
- `CERTIFICATE_SECRET`: Secret for certificate signing
- `DB_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`: Number of days to retain backups
- `APP_CPU_LIMIT`, `DB_CPU_LIMIT`, etc.: Resource limits for containers
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Webhook for notifications
- `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Grafana admin password

## AI Agent Instructions

As an AI agent working on this project, follow these steps for each task:

1. **Analyze the Codebase**:
   - Review the entire codebase to understand the system architecture
   - Identify relevant files and components for the current task
   - Understand dependencies and integration points

2. **Task Implementation Workflow**:
   - Check the FIXME.md file to identify the current task in the "In Progress" section
   - Set your temperature low to generate precise, production-ready code
   - Implement the task with careful attention to integration with existing systems
   - Ensure proper error handling, logging, and documentation in code
   - Make sure Docker, database, frontend, and backend components are well integrated

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure it works as expected
   - If issues are found, fix them before proceeding
   - Verify that the implementation meets all requirements specified in the task

4. **Documentation and Project Updates**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the implemented feature
   - Update FIXME.md:
     - Move the completed task from "In Progress" to "Finished" with a ✅ mark
     - Add detailed bullet points describing what was implemented
     - Move the next task from "To Be Done" to "In Progress"
   - Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md with the next steps
   - Update README.md if necessary to reflect the new feature
   - Create an implementation report in docs/implementation-reports/

5. **Project Improvement**:
   - After completing the assigned task, review the entire project
   - Identify any issues or improvements not listed in FIXME.md
   - Add these as new tasks to the "To Be Done" section if appropriate

6. **Final Check**:
   - Ensure all files are properly formatted and free of errors
   - Verify that no duplicate content was introduced
   - Check that all documentation is clear and comprehensive
   - Confirm that the next AI agent will have clear instructions on what to do next
