## Testing Strategy

The Certificate Verification System employs a comprehensive testing strategy that includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete user workflows
- **Load Tests**: Testing system performance under load
- **Security Tests**: Identifying security vulnerabilities

This multi-layered approach ensures that the system is thoroughly tested from different perspectives, providing confidence in its reliability, performance, and security.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, ensuring that each component functions correctly on its own.

### Framework

We use Jest as our primary unit testing framework, with TypeScript support through ts-jest.

### Directory Structure

Unit tests are located in the `__tests__` directory, mirroring the structure of the source code:

```
__tests__/
├── api-contracts/
├── hooks/
├── i18n/
├── qr-generation/
└── template-signing/
```

### Writing Unit Tests

When writing unit tests:

1. Focus on testing a single unit of functionality
2. Mock external dependencies
3. Test both success and failure cases
4. Keep tests simple and focused

Example:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from '@jest/globals';
import { validateCertificate } from '../../lib/validation';

describe('Certificate Validation', () => {
  it('should validate a valid certificate', () => {
    const validCertificate = {
      id: 'CERT-2024-001',
      recipientName: 'John Doe',
      issueDate: '2024-01-01',
      // ...other fields
    };
    
    const result = validateCertificate(validCertificate);
    expect(result.valid).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('should reject an invalid certificate', () => {
    const invalidCertificate = {
      // Missing required fields
      id: 'CERT-2024-002',
    };
    
    const result = validateCertificate(invalidCertificate);
    expect(result.valid).toBe(false);
    expect(result.errors).toContain('recipientName is required');
  });
});
```

## Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different components of the system work together correctly.

### Framework

We use Jest for integration testing, with additional utilities like `node-mocks-http` for simulating HTTP requests and responses.

### Directory Structure

Integration tests are located in the `__tests__/integration` directory:

```
__tests__/
├── integration/
│   ├── certificate-generation.test.ts
│   └── certificate-verification.test.ts
```

### Writing Integration Tests

When writing integration tests:

1. Focus on testing interactions between components
2. Test realistic scenarios
3. Include edge cases
4. Test error handling

Example:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeAll, afterAll } from '@jest/globals';
import { createMocks } from 'node-mocks-http';
import handler from '../../pages/api/certificates/verify';

describe('Certificate Verification API', () => {
  it('should verify a valid certificate', async () => {
    const { req, res } = createMocks({
      method: 'POST',
      body: {
        certificateId: 'CERT-2024-001'
      }
    });

    await handler(req, res);

    expect(res._getStatusCode()).toBe(200);
    const data = JSON.parse(res._getData());
    expect(data.valid).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('should reject an invalid certificate', async () => {
    const { req, res } = createMocks({
      method: 'POST',
      body: {
        certificateId: 'INVALID-ID'
      }
    });

    await handler(req, res);

    expect(res._getStatusCode()).toBe(200);
    const data = JSON.parse(res._getData());
    expect(data.valid).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

## End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests verify that the entire system works correctly from a user's perspective.

### Framework

We use Cypress for end-to-end testing, which allows us to simulate user interactions with the application.

### Directory Structure

End-to-end tests are located in the `cypress/e2e` directory:

```
cypress/
├── e2e/
│   ├── accessibility.cy.ts
│   ├── admin-workflow.cy.ts
│   ├── bulk-generation.cy.ts
│   ├── error-boundaries.cy.ts
│   ├── public-verification.cy.ts
│   ├── rbac-coverage.cy.ts
│   └── student-workflow.cy.ts
```

### Writing End-to-End Tests

When writing end-to-end tests:

1. Focus on testing complete user workflows
2. Test from a user's perspective
3. Include assertions about the UI state
4. Test performance where relevant

Example:

```typescript
describe('Public Verification Workflow', () => {
  it('should verify a certificate using QR code', () => {
    cy.visit('/verify');
    cy.get('[data-testid="qr-scanner"]').should('be.visible');

    // Simulate QR scan result
    cy.window().then((win) => {
      win.postMessage({ type: 'QR_SCAN_RESULT', data: 'CERT-2024-001' }, '*');
    });

    cy.get('[data-testid="verification-result"]').should('be.visible');
    cy.get('[data-testid="valid-result"]').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

## Load Testing

Load tests verify that the system performs well under expected and peak loads.

### Framework

We use k6 for load testing, which allows us to simulate multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.

### Directory Structure

Load testing scripts are located in the `scripts/load-testing` directory:

```
scripts/
├── load-testing/
│   ├── certificate-verification.js
│   ├── certificate-generation.js
│   └── run-load-tests.sh
```

### Writing Load Tests

When writing load tests:

1. Define realistic scenarios
2. Include different types of load patterns (constant, ramp-up, spike)
3. Set appropriate thresholds
4. Measure relevant metrics

Example:

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep, check } from 'k6';
import { Trend } from 'k6/metrics';

const verificationDuration = new Trend('verification_duration');

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    constant_load: {
      executor: 'constant-vus',
      vus: 50,
      duration: '1m',
    },
  },
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    'verification_duration': ['p(95)<1000'],
  },
};

export default function() {
  const startTime = new Date();
  
  const response = http.post('http://localhost:3000/api/certificates/verify', 
    JSON.stringify({ certificateId: 'CERT-2024-001' }),
    {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    }
  );
  
  const duration = new Date() - startTime;
  verificationDuration.add(duration);
  
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'verification is valid': (r) => JSON.parse(r.body).valid === true,
  });
  
  sleep(1);
}
```

### Running Load Tests

To run load tests:

```bash
npm run test:load
```

This will execute the load testing scripts and generate reports in the `load-test-results` directory.

## Security Testing

Security tests identify potential security vulnerabilities in the system.

### Framework

We use a combination of tools for security testing:

- ESLint with security plugins for static code analysis
- npm audit for dependency vulnerability scanning
- OWASP Dependency-Check for comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- Snyk for continuous vulnerability monitoring
- ZAP for dynamic application security testing

### Directory Structure

Security testing scripts are located in the `scripts` directory:

```
scripts/
├── security-scan.sh
```

### Running Security Tests

To run security tests:

```bash
npm run security:scan
```

This will execute the security scanning scripts and generate reports in the `security-scan-results` directory.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that tests are run automatically when code changes are pushed to the repository.

### CI Pipeline

We use GitHub Actions for CI, with a workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The workflow includes:

1. Linting
2. Unit and integration testing
3. Building the application
4. Security scanning
5. Load testing (on main branch only)

### CI Configuration

The CI configuration is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: Certificate Verification System CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint

  test:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: lint
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:ci
```

## Test Coverage

Test coverage measures how much of the codebase is covered by tests.

### Coverage Targets

We aim for the following coverage targets:

- Statements: 80%
- Branches: 80%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%

### Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated when running tests with the `--coverage` flag:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

This will generate coverage reports in the `coverage` directory, including HTML reports that can be viewed in a browser.
