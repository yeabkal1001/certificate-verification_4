## Disaster Recovery Strategy

The Certificate Verification System employs a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy that includes:

1. **Regular Backups**: Automated daily backups of all critical data
2. **Offsite Storage**: Backup data stored in multiple geographic locations
3. **Redundant Infrastructure**: Critical components deployed with redundancy
4. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Proactive detection of potential issues
5. **Documented Recovery Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions for recovery
6. **Regular Testing**: Periodic testing of recovery procedures

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

The maximum acceptable time to restore system functionality after a disaster:

- **Critical Functions** (Certificate Verification): 1 hour
- **Important Functions** (Certificate Management): 4 hours
- **Normal Functions** (Administrative Features): 24 hours

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

The maximum acceptable data loss in case of a disaster:

- **Database**: 15 minutes (using transaction logs)
- **File Storage**: 1 hour
- **Configuration**: 24 hours

## Backup Procedures

### Database Backups

1. **Full Backups**:
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Retention: 30 days
   - Storage: Local and offsite (S3)

2. **Transaction Log Backups**:
   - Frequency: Every 15 minutes
   - Retention: 7 days
   - Storage: Local and offsite (S3)

3. **Backup Verification**:
   - Each backup is automatically verified for integrity
   - Monthly restore tests are performed in a test environment

### File Storage Backups

1. **Certificate PDFs**:
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Retention: 30 days
   - Storage: Local and offsite (S3)

2. **Template Assets**:
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Retention: 30 days
   - Storage: Local and offsite (S3)

### Configuration Backups

1. **Environment Configuration**:

### Backup Automation

Backups are automated using the following scripts:

- `scripts/db-backup/backup.sh`: Database backup script
- `scripts/db-backup/schedule-backups.sh`: Configures scheduled backups
- `scripts/db-backup/verify.sh`: Verifies backup integrity

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

   ./scripts/db-backup/apply-logs.sh /path/to/logs/
   ```

2. **Point-in-Time Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Restore from the latest full backup
   ./scripts/db-backup/restore.sh /path/to/backup/file.sql.gz
   
   # Apply transaction logs up to a specific time
   ./scripts/db-backup/apply-logs.sh /path/to/logs/ --until="2023-01-01 12:00:00"
   ```

### Application Recovery

   ```

## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Database Corruption

**Impact**: Loss of access to certificate data, user accounts, and templates.

**Recovery Procedure**:

1. Stop the application to prevent further corruption:
   ```bash
   docker-compose stop app
   ```

2. Assess the extent of corruption:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db execute --stdin < /dev/null
   ```

3. Restore the database from the latest backup:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-backup/restore.sh /path/to/latest/backup.sql.gz
   ```

4. Apply transaction logs if needed:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-backup/apply-logs.sh /path/to/logs/
   ```

5. Verify database integrity:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/optimize-database.js --verify-only
   ```

6. Restart the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose start app
   ```

7. Verify system functionality:
   ```bash
   curl http://your-domain.com/api/health
   ```

   sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
   ```

3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/certificate-verification.git
   cd certificate-verification
   ```

4. Restore configuration:
   ```bash
   # Restore environment configuration
   cp /path/to/backup/.env .env
   ```

5. Restore the database:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-backup/restore.sh /path/to/latest/backup.sql.gz
   ```

6. Restore file storage:
   ```bash
   # Restore certificate PDFs
   cp -r /path/to/backup/certificates ./storage/certificates

   sudo ifconfig eth0 down
   ```

2. Assess the breach scope and impact.

3. Change all secrets and credentials:
   ```bash
   # Generate new secrets
   ./scripts/generate-secrets.sh
   
   # Update database passwords
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER certuser WITH PASSWORD 'new-password';"
   
   # Update environment variables
   nano .env
   ```

4. Restore the system from a known good backup:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-backup/restore.sh /path/to/pre-breach/backup.sql.gz
   ```

5. Apply security patches:
   ```bash
   # Update dependencies
   npm audit fix
   
   # Update system packages
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

6. Scan for vulnerabilities:
   ```bash
   npm audit

   ```

### Scenario 4: Natural Disaster

**Impact**: Complete loss of primary data center.

**Recovery Procedure**:

1. Activate the secondary data center or cloud environment.

2. Restore from offsite backups:
   ```bash
   # Download database backup from S3
   aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket/backups/latest.sql.gz /tmp/
   
   # Restore database
   ./scripts/db-backup/restore.sh /tmp/latest.sql.gz
   ```

3. Restore file storage from offsite backups:
   ```bash
   # Download file storage from S3
   aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket/file-storage/ ./storage/ --recursive
   ```

4. Update DNS records to point to the new environment:
   ```bash
   # Example with AWS Route 53
   aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id YOUR_ZONE_ID --change-batch file://dns-update.json
   ```

5. Deploy the application in the new environment:
   ```bash
